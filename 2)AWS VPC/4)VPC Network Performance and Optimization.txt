# Network Performance basics:
-----------------------------
->Bandwidth: The maximum rate of data transfer across a network path. In AWS, bandwidth can vary based on instance type, network configuration, and region.
->Latency: The time it takes for a data packet to travel from source to destination. Lower latency is crucial for real-time applications.
->Jitter: The variation in packet arrival times. High jitter can affect the quality of real-time communications.
->Packet Loss: The percentage of packets that are lost during transmission. Minimizing packet loss is essential for maintaining data integrity.
->throughput: The actual rate of successful data transfer over a network, often measured in bits per second (bps).
->Packet per Second (PPS): A measure of how many packets are processed by a network device or system in one second.
->Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU): The largest size of a packet that can be transmitted over a network. In AWS, the default MTU for VPCs is 1500 bytes, but it can be increased to 9001 bytes for enhanced networking.
-----------------------------

# Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) in AWS VPC in different scenarios:
----------------------------------------------
-> Default MTU for AWS VPC: 1500 bytes.
-> Jumbo Frames Support: AWS VPCs support jumbo frames with an MTU of up to 9001 bytes for enhanced networking.
-> Enhanced Networking: To utilize jumbo frames, instances must be launched with enhanced networking capabilities, such as using the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) or Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) interface.
-> Inter-VPC Communication: When communicating between VPCs using VPC peering or AWS Transit Gateway, ensure that both VPCs are configured to support the same MTU settings to avoid fragmentation.
-> VPN Connections: When using VPN connections, the effective MTU may be lower than the VPC MTU due to encapsulation overhead. It is recommended to adjust the MTU settings on instances accordingly.
-> Direct Connect: AWS Direct Connect connections can support jumbo frames, but the MTU must be configured on both the AWS side and the customer side to ensure compatibility.
-> Testing and Verification: Use tools like ping with the "Don't Fragment" (DF) flag to test and verify the MTU settings between instances in the VPC.

# EC2 Network Optimization Techniques:
--------------------------------
1)cluster placement groups
-> Cluster placement groups are designed to provide low-latency, high-bandwidth networking between instances by placing them physically close together within a single Availability Zone.
-> Ideal for applications that require high network throughput and low latency, such as high-performance computing (HPC) and big data analytics.
2)EBS optimized instances
-> EBS-optimized instances provide dedicated bandwidth for Amazon EBS I/O, ensuring that network traffic between the instance and EBS volumes does not compete with other network traffic.
-> This optimization is particularly beneficial for applications with high I/O requirements, such as databases and data warehousing.
3)Enhanced networking
-> Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, lower latency, and lower jitter by using single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to deliver high-performance networking capabilities.
-> To use enhanced networking, instances must be launched with compatible instance types and network interfaces, such as the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) or Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) interface.
4)Use of placement groups
-> Placement groups allow you to influence the placement of a group of interdependent instances to meet the needs of your workload.
-> There are three types of placement groups: Cluster, Spread, and Partition placement groups, each designed for different use cases and optimization strategies.
