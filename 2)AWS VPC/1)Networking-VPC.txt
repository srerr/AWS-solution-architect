Section 27: VPC 
----------------
-> CIDR calculation link: https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr
->Classless inter-Domain Routing - a method for allocating IP addresses.
->used in Security Groups and Network ACLs.
->they help to define an IP address range for a VPC.
->A CIDR consists of two components
    ->1. The base IP address
        ->This is the starting point of the IP address range.
        ->represents an IP contained in the range(XX.XX.XX.XX)
    ->2. The subnet mask
        ->defines how many bits can change in the IP
        ->example: /0,/8,/16,/24,/32
        ->can take two forms:
            ->/8 -> 255.0.0.0
            ->/16 -> 255.255.0.0
            ->/24 -> 255.255.255.0
            ->/32 -> 255.255.255.255
->The subnet mask basically allows part of the underlying IP to get additional next values from the base IP.

#public vs. private IP (IP):
----------------------------
->the internet assigned numbers authority(IANA) established certain blocks of IPv4 addresses for the use of private (LAN) and pulic (internet) addresses.
->Private IP can only allow certain values:
    ->10.0.0.0 -> 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8) => in big networks
    ->172.16.0.0 -> 172.31.255.255 (172.31.0.0/12)=> aws default VPC in that range
    ->192.168.0.0 -> 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16) => in small networks(eg home networks)
->all the rest of the IPs are public IPs.

#Default VPC Walkthrough:
--------------------------
->All new AWS accounts have a default VPC in each region.
->The default VPC is a VPC that is created automatically when you create an AWS account.
->New EC2 instances are launched into the default VPC if no subnet is specified.
->Default VPC has internet connectivity by default. and all EC2 instances launched into the default VPC have public IP addresses.
->we also get a public and a private IPv4 DNS names.
->you can have multiple vpc's in an AWS region(max. 5 per region-soft limit).
->Max CIDR per VPC IS 5, for each CIDR:
    ->you can have a primary CIDR and 4 secondary CIDRs.
    ->the primary CIDR must be between /16 and /28.
    ->the secondary CIDRs must be between /16 and /28.
    ->the maximum number of IP addresses in a VPC is 65,536 (2^16).

#subnet:
--------
->AWS reserves 5IP addresses (first 4 & last 1) in each subnet.
->These 5 IP addresses are not available for use and can't be assigned to an EC2 instance.
->Example: 
    ->If you create a subnet with a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/24, the following IP addresses are reserved:
        ->10.0.0.0 (Network Address)
        ->10.0.0.1 (Reserved for the VPC router)
        ->10.0.0.2 (Reserved for DNS)
        ->10.0.0.3 (Reserved for future use)
        ->10.0.0.255 (Broadcast Address)

#internet gateway:
-------------------
->An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in your VPC and the internet.
->one vpc can have only one internet gateway.
->internet gateway is a fully managed service that scales automatically to handle the traffic.
->ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path) routing is supported by internet gateways, allowing multiple paths for outbound traffic to the internet.
->To enable internet access for instances in a VPC, you must attach an internet gateway to the VPC and configure the route table of the subnet to route internet-bound traffic to the internet gateway. 

#route table:
-------------------
->A route table is a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.
->Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table.
->By default, each route table contains a local route that enables communication between instances in the same VPC.
->You can add custom routes to the route table to enable communication with other networks, such as the internet or your on-premises network.

#NAT Gateway:
-------------------
->A NAT (Network Address Translation) gateway is a managed NAT service that provides internet access to instances in a private subnet.
->NAT gateways allow instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while preventing unsolicited inbound traffic from the internet.
->You can create a NAT gateway in a public subnet and configure the route table of the private subnet to route internet-bound traffic to the NAT gateway.

#NAT Instance:
--------------
->A NAT instance is an EC2 instance that you configure to perform NAT for instances in a private subnet.
->NAT instances allow instances in a private subnet to initiate outbound traffic to the internet while preventing unsolicited inbound traffic from the internet.
->You can create a NAT instance in a public subnet and configure the route table of the private subnet to route internet-bound traffic to the NAT instance.

#NACL (Network Access Control List):
------------------------------------
->A NACL is a stateless firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.
->NACLs operate at the subnet level and can be associated with one or more subnets in a VPC.
->NACLs allow you to define rules that control traffic based on IP protocol, port number, and source/destination IP address.
->NACLs are stateless, meaning that if you allow inbound traffic, you must also allow the corresponding outbound traffic.
->NACLs have a number (1-32766) to determine the order of evaluation, with lower numbers being evaluated first.

#Security Groups:
-------------------
->Security groups are stateful firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level.
->Security groups operate at the instance level and can be associated with one or more instances in a VPC.
->Security groups allow you to define rules that control traffic based on IP protocol, port number, and source/destination IP address.
->Security groups are stateful, meaning that if you allow inbound traffic, the corresponding outbound traffic is automatically allowed.

#Ephemeral Ports:
-------------------
->Ephemeral ports are temporary ports that are used by the operating system to establish outbound connections.
->When an instance initiates an outbound connection, the operating system assigns an ephemeral port to the connection.
->Ephemeral ports are typically in the range of 1024 to 65535.
->Different operating systems may have different ranges for ephemeral ports, but the range of 1024 to 65535 is commonly used.
    ->IANA & MS Windows 10 => 49152 to 65535
    ->Linux => 32768 to 60999
    ->macOS => 49152 to 65535

#VPC Peering:
-------------------
->VPC peering is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.
->VPC peering can be established between VPCs in the same AWS account or in different AWS accounts.
->VPC peering is a one-to-one relationship, meaning that each VPC can be peered with another VPC, but not with multiple VPCs at the same time.
->VPC peering does not support transitive routing, meaning that if VPC A is peered with VPC B, and VPC B is peered with VPC C, VPC A cannot communicate with VPC C through VPC B.

#VPC Endpoints(VPC level):
--------------------------
->VPC endpoints are virtual devices that enable you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink.
->VPC endpoints allow you to access AWS services without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.
->VPC endpoints are available in two types:
    ->Interface Endpoints: These endpoints are used to connect to AWS services that support PrivateLink, such as Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Lambda.
    ->Gateway Endpoints: These endpoints are used to connect to AWS services that do not support PrivateLink, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB.
->VPC endpoints are highly available and scalable, and they provide a secure and private connection to AWS services.
->gateway is most commonly used for S3 and DynamoDB. we use route tables to control access to the endpoint.
->interface is used for most other services. we use security groups with interface endpoints to control access to the endpoint.

#VPC Flow Logs:
-------------------
->VPC Flow Logs are a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
->Flow logs can be used for monitoring, troubleshooting, and security analysis of your VPC traffic.
->You can create flow logs for individual network interfaces, subnets, or the entire VPC.
->Flow log data is published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3, where you can analyze it using various tools.
->Flow logs capture information such as source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and the number of bytes transferred.
->VPC flow logs syntax:
    ->version
    ->account-id
    ->interface-id
    ->srcaddr
    ->dstaddr
    ->srcport
    ->dstport
    ->protocol
    ->packets
    ->bytes
    ->start
    ->end
    ->action (ACCEPT or REJECT)
    ->log-status (OK, NODATA, SKIPDATA)
    ex: 2 123456789012 eni-abc123de 172.31.0.0 172.31.0.1 12345 80 6 10 1000 1618915200 1618915260 ACCEPT OK    

#AWS site-to-site VPN:
----------------------
->AWS site-to-site VPN is a service that enables you to securely connect your on-premises network or branch office to your AWS VPC.
->Site-to-site VPN uses IPsec (Internet Protocol Security) to create a secure and encrypted connection over the internet.
->You can create a site-to-site VPN connection using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.
->Site-to-site VPN supports both static and dynamic routing, allowing you to choose the routing method that best fits your network architecture.

#AWS Direct Connect:
----------------------
->AWS Direct Connect is a service that enables you to establish a dedicated network connection from your on-premises data center to your AWS VPC.
->Direct Connect provides a more consistent network experience compared to internet-based connections.
->You can create a Direct Connect connection using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.
->Direct Connect supports both public and private virtual interfaces, allowing you to connect to AWS services or your VPC.

#AWS Transit Gateway:
----------------------
->AWS Transit Gateway is a service that enables you to connect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks through a single gateway.
->Transit Gateway simplifies network architecture by providing a central hub for routing traffic between connected networks.
->You can create a Transit Gateway using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.
->Transit Gateway supports both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic, and it can be used to connect VPCs in the same AWS account or in different AWS accounts.

#IP V6:
----------------------
->IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol (IP), designed to replace IPv4.
->IPv6 provides a larger address space than IPv4, allowing for a virtually unlimited number of unique IP addresses.
->AWS services support IPv6, enabling you to assign IPv6 addresses to your VPCs, subnets, and network interfaces.
->You can use IPv6 in conjunction with IPv4, allowing for dual-stack networking.

#egress only internet gateway:
-----------------------------
->An egress-only internet gateway is a VPC component that allows outbound IPv6 traffic from instances in your VPC to the internet while preventing unsolicited inbound traffic from the internet.
->Egress-only internet gateways are used to enable IPv6-enabled instances in a private subnet to access the internet for software updates, patches, and other outbound traffic.
->You can create an egress-only internet gateway using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs.
