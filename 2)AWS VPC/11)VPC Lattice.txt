    => VPC Lattice components:
        1. Service Network: A service network is a logical grouping of services that can communicate with each other. It provides a secure and scalable way to connect your applications across multiple VPCs and on-premises environments.
        2. Service: A service is a logical representation of an application or a microservice that you want to connect using VPC Lattice. It can be running in a VPC, on-premises, or even across different AWS accounts.
        3. Resource: A resource is a specific instance of a service that you want to connect. It can be an EC2 instance, a Lambda function, or any other resource that you want to include in your service network. 
        4. Service Directory: A service directory is a registry of services and resources that are part of your service network. It allows you to discover and manage the services and resources in your service network, making it easier to connect and manage your applications. 
        4. Auth Policy: An auth policy is a set of rules that define how your applications can communicate with each other. It allows you to implement security policies for your applications, ensuring that your data is protected as it flows between your applications.
