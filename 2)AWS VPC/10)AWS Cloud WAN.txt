        - Connecting on-premises data centers to AWS resources
        - Building a global network for distributed applications
        - Enabling secure remote access for remote workers
        - Optimizing network performance for latency-sensitive applications
    => With Cloud WAN, you can take advantage of the AWS global network to build a high-performance, resilient WAN that meets the needs of your business, without having to worry about managing the underlying infrastructure. 
    => Cloud WAN is designed to be easy to use, with a simple, intuitive interface that allows you to quickly set up and manage your global network. You can create and manage your network using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs, making it easy to integrate Cloud WAN into your existing workflows and tools.
    => Cloud WAN also provides a range of security features to help you protect your network and data, including encryption, access control, and monitoring. You can use Cloud WAN to create secure connections between your on-premises data centers and AWS resources, ensuring that your data is protected as it travels across the network. 
    => Overall, AWS Cloud WAN is a powerful and flexible service that can help you build and manage a global network that connects your resources across the cloud and on-premises environments, while providing the performance, security, and visibility you need to optimize your network for your business needs.

    # Core Network Policy:
        => A core network policy is a set of rules that define how traffic is routed and managed within a core network. In the context of AWS Cloud WAN, a core network policy is used to define the routing and management of traffic within a global network that connects resources across the cloud and on-premises environments. 
        => A core network policy typically includes rules for routing traffic between different locations, as well as rules for managing traffic based on factors such as latency, bandwidth, and security requirements. For example, a core network policy might specify that traffic between two locations should be routed through a specific AWS region to optimize performance, or that certain types of traffic should be prioritized over others to ensure that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth. 
        => Core network policies can be created and managed using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs, making it easy to integrate them into your existing workflows and tools. By defining and implementing effective core network policies, you can optimize the performance and security of your global network while ensuring that your applications and resources are able to communicate effectively across the cloud and on-premises environments.  
        
        1)Network Segments: A core network policy can define different network segments within a global network, which can be used to group resources based on factors such as location, application type, or security requirements. For example, you might create separate network segments for your on-premises data centers and your AWS resources, or for different types of applications that require different levels of performance and security.
        2)Routing Policies: A core network policy can define routing policies that determine how traffic is routed between different locations within the global network. For example, you might specify that traffic between two locations should be routed through a specific AWS region to optimize performance, or that certain types of traffic should be prioritized over others to ensure that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth.
        3)Security Policies: A core network policy can define security policies that govern how traffic is secured as it travels across the global network. For example, you might specify that all traffic between on-premises data centers and AWS resources must be encrypted using specific protocols, or that access to certain resources is restricted based on user roles and permissions.
        4)Traffic Management Policies: A core network policy can define traffic management policies that govern how traffic is managed based on factors such as latency, bandwidth, and application requirements. For example, you might specify that certain types of traffic should be prioritized during peak usage periods, or that traffic from specific applications should be routed through low-latency paths to ensure optimal performance.
        5)Monitoring and Logging Policies: A core network policy can define monitoring and logging policies that govern how network traffic is monitored and logged for performance, security, and compliance purposes. For example, you might specify that all traffic between on-premises data centers and AWS resources must be logged for auditing purposes, or that specific performance metrics should be monitored to ensure that the network is operating within acceptable parameters. 
        6)Attachment Policies: A core network policy can define attachment policies that govern how different resources are connected to the global network. For example, you might specify that certain types of resources, such as branch offices or remote workers, must connect to the network using specific protocols or security measures to ensure that they are properly integrated into the overall network architecture. 
        7)Quality of Service (QoS) Policies: A core network policy can define QoS policies that prioritize certain types of traffic to ensure that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth and performance. For example, you might specify that voice and video traffic should be prioritized over other types of traffic to ensure high-quality communication for remote workers.    
        8)Network configuration Policies: A core network policy can define network configuration policies that govern how different resources are configured to connect to the global network. For example, you might specify that certain types of resources must use specific IP addressing schemes or DNS configurations to ensure that they are properly integrated into the overall network architecture.  

        Example:
            => An organization has a global network that connects its on-premises data centers, branch offices, and AWS resources using AWS Cloud WAN. The organization wants to implement a core network policy to optimize the performance and security of its network.
            => The core network policy includes the following rules:
                1)Network Segments: The organization creates separate network segments for its on-premises data centers and AWS resources, as well as for different types of applications that require different levels of performance and security.
                2)Routing Policies: The organization specifies that traffic between its on-premises data centers and AWS resources should be routed through specific AWS regions to optimize performance, and that certain types of traffic should be prioritized over others to ensure that critical applications receive the necessary bandwidth.
                3)Security Policies: The organization specifies that all traffic between its on-premises data centers and AWS resources must be encrypted using specific protocols, and that access to certain resources is restricted based on user roles and permissions.
                4)Traffic Management Policies: The organization specifies that certain types of traffic should be prioritized during peak usage periods, and that traffic from specific applications should be routed through low-latency paths to ensure optimal performance.
                5)Monitoring and Logging Policies: The organization specifies that all traffic between its on-premises data centers and AWS resources must be logged for auditing purposes, and that specific performance metrics should be monitored to ensure that the network is operating within acceptable parameters.
            => By implementing this core network policy, the organization is able to optimize the performance and security of its global network while ensuring that its applications and resources are able to communicate effectively across the cloud and on-premises environments.
