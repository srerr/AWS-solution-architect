# AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB):
-----------------------------------
    => ELB is a service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. It helps improve the availability and fault tolerance of your applications.
    => ELB supports three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), and Classic Load Balancer (CLB). Each type is designed for different use cases and offers specific features.
    => ELB provides features such as SSL termination, health checks, and sticky sessions to enhance the performance and security of your applications. It also integrates with other AWS services, such as Auto Scaling and AWS Certificate Manager, to provide a seamless experience for managing your applications.   
    => ELB is a fully managed service that automatically scales to handle the incoming traffic and provides high availability for your applications. It also offers built-in security features, such as support for SSL/TLS encryption and integration with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for access control.    
    => ELB is a cost-effective solution for distributing traffic across multiple targets, as you only pay for the resources you use. It also provides detailed monitoring and logging capabilities through Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail, allowing you to track the performance and security of your applications.   
    => ELB is commonly used in scenarios such as web applications, microservices architectures, and containerized applications to ensure high availability and scalability. It can also be used to distribute traffic across multiple Availability Zones for improved fault tolerance and disaster recovery.    
    => ELB is a critical component of many AWS architectures, as it helps ensure that applications can handle varying levels of traffic and maintain high availability. It is often used in conjunction with other AWS services, such as Auto Scaling, Amazon EC2, and Amazon RDS, to create scalable and resilient applications in the cloud.  
    => ELB provides a range of features to enhance the performance and security of your applications, including support for SSL/TLS encryption, integration with AWS Certificate Manager for managing SSL certificates, and support for WebSocket and HTTP/2 protocols. It also offers advanced routing capabilities, such as path-based routing and host-based routing, to help you direct traffic to the appropriate targets based on the content of the request.

It is often used in conjunction with other AWS services, such as Auto Scaling, Amazon EC2, and Amazon RDS, to create scalable and resilient applications in the cloud.   
    # Types of ELB:
        1) Application Load Balancer (ALB): ALB is designed for applications that operate at the application layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model. It provides advanced routing capabilities, such as path-based routing and host-based routing, and supports features like SSL termination and WebSocket protocols. ALB is ideal for web applications, microservices architectures, and containerized applications.    
        2) Network Load Balancer (NLB): NLB is designed for applications that operate at the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model. It provides high performance and low latency, making it suitable for applications that require extreme performance, such as gaming, real-time streaming, and IoT applications. NLB supports features like SSL termination and static IP addresses.    
        3) Classic Load Balancer (CLB): CLB is the original load balancer offered by AWS and is designed for applications that operate at both the application layer (Layer 7) and the transport layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model. It provides basic load balancing capabilities and is suitable for applications that do not require advanced routing features. CLB is being phased out in favor of ALB and NLB, and AWS recommends using ALB or NLB for new applications. 
        4) Gateway Load Balancer (GLB): GLB is designed for applications that require advanced traffic management and security features. It operates at the network layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model and provides features such as traffic mirroring, flow-based routing, and integration with AWS Network Firewall. GLB is ideal for applications that require deep packet inspection and advanced security capabilities.
