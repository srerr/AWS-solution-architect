# High Availability and Scalability
## Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)
- Automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances.
- Provides high availability by routing traffic only to healthy instances.
- Supports both application and network load balancing.

## Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)
- Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances in response to changing demand.
- Ensures that the right number of instances are running to handle the load.
- Can be configured to scale in (terminate instances) or scale out (launch instances) based on CloudWatch metrics.
