            => SSE encrypts your data at rest using encryption keys managed by AWS.
            => There are three options for SSE:
                a) SSE-S3: S3 manages the encryption keys for you.
                    => S3 automatically encrypts your objects when you upload them and decrypts them when you access them.
                    => SSE-S3 is the simplest option, as it requires no additional configuration or key management.
                    => S3 uses AES-256 encryption to protect your data.
                    => SSE-S3 is suitable for most use cases, providing strong encryption without the need for additional key management.
                    => SSE-S3 is automatically applied to all objects in a bucket unless you specify otherwise.
                b) SSE-KMS: AWS Key Management Service (KMS) manages the encryption keys, providing additional control and auditing capabilities.
                    => SSE-KMS allows you to create and manage your own encryption keys, providing more control over data security.

                c) SSE-C: You provide your own encryption keys, and S3 uses them to encrypt and decrypt your objects.
                    => SSE-C allows you to manage your own encryption keys, giving you full control over the encryption process.
                    => You must provide the encryption key in the request headers when uploading or downloading objects.
                    => S3 does not store the encryption keys, so you must ensure they are securely managed and accessible.
                    => SSE-C is suitable for applications that require strict control over encryption keys and compliance with security standards.
                    => SSE-C requires additional management on your part, as you must securely store and access the encryption keys.
        2) Client-Side Encryption:
            => You encrypt your data before uploading it to S3, using your own encryption libraries or tools.
            => This gives you full control over the encryption process and keys, but requires additional management on your part.
            => You must also manage the encryption keys and ensure they are securely stored and accessed.
            => Client-side encryption is useful for applications that require strict control over data security and compliance.
            => It is important to implement proper key management practices to protect your encryption keys.
            => Client-side encryption can be implemented using various libraries and tools, such as the AWS Encryption SDK or third-party libraries.

        => S3 CORS policies can also include preflight requests, which are used by browsers to check if the actual request is allowed before sending it.    
#Amazon S3 MFA Delete:
------------------------
        => Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Delete is a feature that adds an extra layer of security to S3 buckets.
        => MFA Delete requires additional authentication for certain actions, such as deleting objects or changing bucket versioning settings.
        => To enable MFA Delete, you must first enable versioning on the S3 bucket.
        => Once MFA Delete is enabled, any requests to delete objects or change versioning settings must include a valid MFA token.
        => MFA Delete helps prevent accidental or malicious deletions of S3 objects, providing an additional safeguard for your data.
        => It is important to securely manage the MFA devices and ensure they are accessible when needed.
# Amazon S3 Access logging:
-----------------------------
        => S3 Access Logging is a feature that allows you to log requests made to your S3 buckets, providing visibility into access patterns and usage.
        => Access logs can be enabled at the bucket level, and they capture information such as the requester's IP address, request time, HTTP method, and response status.
        => The logs are stored in a designated S3 bucket, allowing you to analyze and process them using tools like Amazon Athena or AWS Glue.
        => S3 Access Logging is useful for auditing access to your S3 resources, monitoring usage patterns, and troubleshooting issues.
        => You can use access logs to track who accessed your data, when it was accessed, and what actions were performed on the objects.
        => Access logs can also help identify potential security issues or unauthorized access attempts to your S3 buckets. 
# Amazon S3 pre-signed URLs:
-----------------------------
        => Pre-signed URLs are temporary URLs that allow users to access specific S3 objects without requiring AWS credentials.
        => You can generate pre-signed URLs for GET or PUT requests, allowing users to download or upload objects securely.
        => Pre-signed URLs are useful for sharing S3 objects with users who do not have AWS credentials, such as external partners or customers.
        => You can specify an expiration time for the pre-signed URL, after which it will no longer be valid.
        => Pre-signed URLs can be generated using the AWS SDKs, CLI, or REST API, providing flexibility in how you share S3 objects.
        => They can also be used to control access to specific objects, allowing you to grant temporary access without exposing your AWS credentials.
# Amazon S3 Object Lock:
-----------------------------
        => S3 Object Lock is a feature that allows you to enforce retention policies on S3 objects, preventing them from being deleted or overwritten for a specified period.
        => Object Lock can be used to meet regulatory requirements, such as those imposed by financial or healthcare regulations.
        => You can configure Object Lock at the bucket level or on individual objects, specifying retention periods and legal hold settings.
        => Once Object Lock is enabled, it cannot be disabled, and all actions that would modify or delete the locked objects are blocked.
        => Object Lock helps ensure the integrity and availability of critical data, providing an additional layer of protection against accidental or malicious deletions. 
# Amazon S3 access points:  
---------------------------
        => S3 Access Points are a way to manage access to shared data sets in S3.
        => Access Points allow you to create unique hostnames with specific permissions and network controls for different applications or users.
        => Each Access Point has its own policy, which can be tailored to the needs of the application or user it serves.
        => Access Points simplify data access management by providing a single endpoint for accessing a specific data set.
        => They are particularly useful in multi-tenant environments or when different teams need to access the same S3 bucket with varying permissions.
        => Access Points can also be used in conjunction with VPC endpoints to control access from specific VPCs.
# Amazon S3 Object lambda:
--------------------------
        => S3 Object Lambda is a feature that allows you to add custom processing to the data returned by S3 GET requests.
        => With Object Lambda, you can transform or filter the data before it is returned to the requester, enabling use cases such as data masking, format conversion, or content enrichment.
        => You can create an Object Lambda Access Point that specifies the transformation logic and the S3 bucket containing the original objects.
        => Object Lambda is useful for applications that require dynamic data processing or customization based on user preferences or application logic.
        => It allows you to perform operations on S3 objects without having to download them, reducing data transfer costs and improving performance.
        => Object Lambda can be combined with other S3 features, such as versioning and lifecycle rules, to manage transformed data effectively.
