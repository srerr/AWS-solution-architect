# Amazon S3 versioning:
-----------------------------
        => S3 versioning is a feature that allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in a bucket, providing a way to recover from accidental deletions or overwrites.
        => When versioning is enabled, each time you upload a new version of an object, S3 assigns a unique version ID to that object.
        => You can retrieve, restore, or permanently delete specific versions of an object using the version ID.
        => Versioning can be enabled at the bucket level, and it applies to all objects within the bucket.
        => S3 versioning helps with data recovery and auditing, allowing you to track changes to objects over time.
        => You can use lifecycle policies to manage the retention of object versions, such as transitioning older versions to cheaper storage classes or deleting them after a specified period.
        => Versioning can be combined with S3 Object Lock to prevent deletion or modification of specific versions for compliance purposes.
        => S3 versioning is useful for applications that require data integrity and the ability to roll back to previous versions of objects.
# Amazon S3 replication:
-----------------------------
        => S3 replication is a feature that allows you to automatically replicate objects from one S3 bucket to another, either within the same AWS region or across different regions.
        => Replication can be configured at the bucket level, and it applies to all objects within the source bucket.
        => S3 replication can be used for disaster recovery, data redundancy, and compliance purposes, ensuring that your data is available in multiple locations.
        => You can choose between two types of replication: 
            1) Cross-Region Replication (CRR): Replicates objects to a bucket in a different AWS region.
            2) Same-Region Replication (SRR): Replicates objects to another bucket in the same AWS region.
        => S3 replication supports both full and incremental replication, meaning that only new or modified objects are replicated after the initial setup.
        => You can use replication rules to specify which objects should be replicated based on prefixes or tags, allowing for fine-grained control over replication behavior.
        => S3 replication can be combined with versioning to ensure that all versions of an object are replicated to the destination bucket.
        => You can use S3 replication to create a backup of your data in a different region, providing additional protection against data loss or corruption.
        => S3 replication supports encryption, ensuring that replicated objects are securely transferred and stored in the destination bucket.
