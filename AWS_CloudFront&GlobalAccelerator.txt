# AWS CloudFront & Global Accelerator:
---------------------------------------
    => AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.
    => AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with users globally.
    => Global Accelerator directs traffic to the optimal endpoint based on health, geography, and routing policies.
    => Both services integrate with other AWS services and provide features like DDoS protection, SSL/TLS encryption, and real-time metrics.
    => CloudFront can cache content at edge locations for faster delivery, while Global Accelerator optimizes routing for improved performance.
    => Use cases include website acceleration, media distribution, API acceleration, and global application delivery.

# AWS CloudFront:
----------------------------------------
            => CloudFront supports dynamic and static content delivery, including media streaming and API responses.
            => It provides edge locations around the world to cache content closer to users, reducing latency.
            => CloudFront integrates with AWS services like S3, EC2, and Lambda@Edge for serverless computing at the edge.
            => It offers features like custom SSL certificates, geo-restriction, and access logs for monitoring.
            => CloudFront can be used for both web applications and mobile applications to enhance user experience.

            - User requests content (e.g., image, video, HTML).
            - CloudFront checks if content is cached at the nearest edge location.
            - If cached, CloudFront serves content directly (low latency).
            - If not cached, CloudFront fetches content from the S3 origin, caches it at the edge, and serves it to the user.
            - Subsequent requests are served from the edge cache until the cache expires.

        # AWS CloudFront-Origins:
        ----------------------------------------
            => CloudFront origins are the sources of content that CloudFront delivers to users.
            => You can configure multiple origins for a CloudFront distribution, allowing you to serve content from different sources.
            => Common origin types include Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon EC2 instances, and custom HTTP servers.
            => CloudFront can route requests to the appropriate origin based on path patterns, query strings, and other criteria.
            => You can also configure origin failover to automatically route requests to a backup origin if the primary origin is unavailable.
            => Origin access identity (OAI) can be used to restrict access to S3 buckets, ensuring that only CloudFront can access the content.

                        [Content Delivery]
            
            - CloudFront routes requests to the appropriate origin based on the request path or other criteria.
            - Each origin can have its own caching behavior and settings.
            - This architecture allows for flexible content delivery from multiple sources.
        # AWS CloudFront geo-restriction:

            - Geo-restriction allows you to control access to your content based on the geographic location of your users.
            - You can use geo-restriction to whitelist or blacklist specific countries or regions.
            - This feature is useful for complying with licensing agreements or regulatory requirements.
            - CloudFront uses the viewer's IP address to determine their location and enforce geo-restriction rules.
            - You can configure geo-restriction settings in the CloudFront distribution settings.

        # AWS CloudFront price classes:
            - CloudFront offers different price classes to help you manage costs based on your content delivery needs.
            - Price classes determine the edge locations that CloudFront uses to deliver your content.
            - The available price classes are:
                - Price Class 100: Includes only the least expensive edge locations (U.S., Canada, and Europe).
                - Price Class 200: Includes all edge locations except those in Asia and South America.
                - Price Class All: Includes all edge locations worldwide.
            - You can choose a price class when creating or updating a CloudFront distribution.
            - Using a lower price class can help reduce costs, but may also impact performance for users in regions not covered by the selected class.
        # AWS CloudFront cache invalidation:
            - Cache invalidation is the process of removing cached content from CloudFront edge locations.
            - You can invalidate cached objects to ensure that users receive the latest version of your content.
            - Invalidation requests can be submitted through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or CloudFront API.
            - You can invalidate specific objects by their path or use wildcard patterns to invalidate multiple objects.
            - Cache invalidation is not instantaneous and may take some time to propagate to all edge locations.
#AWS Global Accelerator:
----------------------------------------
            - AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with users globally.
            - It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints, such as EC2 instances, load balancers, or S3 buckets.
            - Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to optimize the path to your application, reducing latency and improving performance.
            - You can configure routing policies to direct user traffic to the optimal endpoint based on health, geography, or other criteria.
            - Global Accelerator provides built-in DDoS protection and integrates with AWS Shield for enhanced security.
            - You can monitor the performance of your application using Amazon CloudWatch metrics and set up alarms for specific thresholds.
            - Global Accelerator is easy to set up and can be managed through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.
